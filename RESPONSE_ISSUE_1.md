### Response to Issue #1

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the design choices for using pytest in our testing framework.

**Why Use Pytest?**  
We chose pytest as it is a powerful testing framework that is widely adopted in the Python community. Its simple syntax and rich feature set make it an ideal choice for our project. Pytest supports fixtures, parameterized testing, and has a vast ecosystem of plugins that enhance its capabilities. This flexibility allows us to write more maintainable and comprehensive tests.

**Advantages of Pytest for This Testing Scenario:**  
1. **Ease of Use:** Pytest's syntax is concise and easy to understand, which helps in reducing the complexity of our tests.  
2. **Rich Features:** It provides built-in support for fixtures, which are essential for setting up the test environment and dependencies.  
3. **Test Discovery:** Pytest automatically discovers tests, making it easier to manage and run a large suite of tests.  
4. **Detailed Reporting:** In case of test failures, pytest provides detailed output, including the exact line of code that failed, which simplifies debugging.  

**Single Test Case Perspective:**  
From pytest's perspective, the referenced test is treated as a single test case. It either passes or fails as a whole, which aligns with our testing philosophy. This design choice simplifies the evaluation of tests, as we can assess the overall success of a feature based on the combined results of its tests.  

**Alternatives and Trade-offs:**  
While pytest is our chosen framework, there are alternatives such as unittest and nose. Each framework has its strengths and weaknesses:
- **Unittest:** Built into the Python standard library; however, it can be more verbose and lacks some of the advanced features of pytest.
- **Nose:** Extends unittest but is less actively maintained than pytest, which may lead to compatibility issues with new Python versions.

In conclusion, we believe that pytest is the right choice for our project due to its rich feature set, ease of use, and the active community that supports it. We appreciate your interest in our testing framework and hope this clarifies our design choices.  

Best regards,  
The Testing Team
